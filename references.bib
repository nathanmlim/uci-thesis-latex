These methods are broadly classified as either structure-based or ligand-based methods. Structure-based methods are in principle analogous to high-throughput screening in that both target and ligand structure information is imperative. Structure-based approaches include ligand docking, pharmacophore, and ligand design methods. The article discusses theory behind the most important methods and recent successful applications. Ligand-based methods use only ligand information for predicting activity depending on its similarity/dissimilarity to previously known active ligands. We review widely used ligand-based methods such as ligand-based pharmacophores, molecular descriptors, and quantitative structure-activity relationships. In addition, important tools such as target/ligand data bases, homology modeling, ligand fingerprint methods, etc., necessary for successful implementation of various computer-aided drug discovery/design methods in a drug discovery campaign are discussed. Finally, computational methods for toxicity prediction and optimization for favorable physiologic properties are discussed with successful examples from literature.},

	abstract = {We describe here a general Amber force field (GAFF) for organic molecules. GAFF is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force fields for proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement of 0.26 A, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 A) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44 A, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to MP2/6-31G* results. The RMS of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 A and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 A and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The RMS error in relative energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. GAFF can be applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion, making it suitable for rational drug design and database searching.},

	abstract = {We present the first global parameterization and validation of a novel charge model, called AM1-BCC, which quickly and efficiently generates high-quality atomic charges for computer simulations of organic molecules in polar media. The goal of the charge model is to produce atomic charges that emulate the HF/6-31G* electrostatic potential (ESP) of a molecule. Underlying electronic structure features, including formal charge and electron delocalization, are first captured by AM1 population charges; simple additive bond charge corrections (BCCs) are then applied to these AM1 atomic charges to produce the AM1-BCC charges. The parameterization of BCCs was carried out by fitting to the HF/6-31G* ESP of a training set of {\textgreater}2700 molecules. Most organic functional groups and their combinations were sampled, as well as an extensive variety of cyclic and fused bicyclic heteroaryl systems. The resulting BCC parameters allow the AM1-BCC charging scheme to handle virtually all types of organic compounds listed in The Merck Index and the NCI Database. Validation of the model was done through comparisons of hydrogen-bonded dimer energies and relative free energies of solvation using AM1-BCC charges in conjunction with the 1994 Cornell et al. forcefield for AMBER.13 Homo- and hetero-dimer hydrogen-bond energies of a diverse set of organic molecules were reproduced to within 0.95 kcal/mol RMS deviation from the ab initio values, and for DNA dimers the energies were within 0.9 kcal/mol RMS deviation from ab initio values. The calculated relative free energies of solvation for a diverse set of monofunctional isosteres were reproduced to within 0.69 kcal/mol of experiment. In all these validation tests, AMBER with the AM1-BCC charge model maintained a correlation coefficient above 0.96. Thus, the parameters presented here for use with the AM1-BCC method present a fast, accurate, and robust alternative to HF/6-31G* ESP-fit charges for general use with the AMBER force field in computer simulations involving organic small molecules. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {The development and validation of a new knowledge-based scoring function (DrugScore) to describe the binding geometry of ligands in proteins is presented. It discriminates efficiently between well-docked ligand binding modes (root-mean-square deviation {\textless}2.0 Å with respect to a crystallographically determined reference complex) and those largely deviating from the native structure, e.g. generated by computer docking programs. Structural information is extracted from crystallographically determined protein-ligand complexes using ReLiBase and converted into distance-dependent pair-preferences and solvent-accessible surface (SAS) dependent singlet preferences for protein and ligand atoms. Definition of an appropriate reference state and accounting for inaccuracies inherently present in experimental data is required to achieve good predictive power. The sum of the pair preferences and the singlet preferences is calculated based on the 3D structure of protein-ligand binding modes generated by docking tools. For two test sets of 91 and 68 protein-ligand complexes, taken from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), the calculated score recognizes poses generated by FlexX deviating {\textless}2 Å from the crystal structure on rank 1 in three quarters of all possible cases. Compared to FlexX, this is a substantial improvement. For ligand geometries generated by DOCK, DrugScore is superior to the “chemical scoring” implemented into this tool, while comparable results are obtained using the “energy scoring” in DOCK. None of the presently known scoring functions achieves comparable power to extract binding modes in agreement with experiment. It is fast to compute, regards implicitly solvation and entropy contributions and produces correctly the geometry of directional interactions. Small deviations in the 3D structure are tolerated and, since only contacts to non-hydrogen atoms are regarded, it is independent from assumptions of protonation states.},

	abstract = {Molecular docking is the most frequently used computational method for studying the interactions between organic molecules and biological macromolecules. In this context, docking allows predicting the preferred pose of a ligand inside a receptor binding site. However, the selection of the “best” solution is not a trivial task, despite the widely accepted selection criterion that the best pose corresponds to the best energy score. Here, several rigid-target docking methods were evaluated on the same dataset with respect to their ability to reproduce crystallographic binding orientations, to test if the best energy score is a reliable criterion for selecting the best solution. For this, two experiments were performed: (A) to reconstruct the ligand-receptor complex by performing docking of the ligand in its own crystal structure receptor (defined as self-docking), and (B) to reconstruct the ligand-receptor complex by performing docking of the ligand in a crystal structure receptor that contains other ligand (defined as cross-docking). Root-mean square deviation (RMSD) was used to evaluate how different the obtained docking orientation is from the corresponding co-crystallized pose of the same ligand molecule. We found that docking score function is capable of predicting crystallographic binding orientations, but the best ranked solution according to the docking energy is not always the pose that reproduces the experimental binding orientation. This happened when self-docking was achieved, but it was critical in cross-docking. Taking into account that docking is typically used with predictive purposes, during cross-docking experiments, our results indicate that the best energy score is not a reliable criterion to select the best solution in common docking applications. It is strongly recommended to choose the best docking solution according to the scoring function along with additional structural criteria described for analogue ligands to assure the selection of a correct docking solution.},

In this paper, we report on the use of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and machine learning to study the binding mechanism of a transition state analogue (DADMe–immucillin-H) to the purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) enzyme. Microsecond-long MD simulations allow us to observe several binding events, following different dynamical routes and reaching diverse binding configurations. These simulations are used to estimate kinetic and thermodynamic quantities, such as kon and binding free energy, obtaining a good agreement with available experimental data. In addition, we advance a hypothesis for the slow-onset inhibition mechanism of DADMe–immucillin-H against PNP. Combining extensive MD simulations with machine learning algorithms could therefore be a fruitful approach for capturing key aspects of drug–target recognition and binding., 
Understanding the dynamics of enzyme-substrate complexation provides an insight into potential drugs, but intermediate states are difficult to observe experimentally. Here, the authors use simulations and machine learning to analyse the binding of transition state inhibitors to purine nucleoside phosphorylase.},

	abstract = {Ligand docking is a widely used tool for lead discovery and binding mode prediction based drug discovery. The greatest challenges in docking occur when the receptor significantly reorganizes upon small molecule binding, thereby requiring an induced fit docking (IFD) approach in which the receptor is allowed to move in order to bind to the ligand optimally. IFD methods have had some success but suffer from a lack of reliability. Complementing IFD with all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) is a straightforward solution in principle but not in practice due to the severe time scale limitations of MD. Here we introduce a metadynamics plus IFD strategy for accurate and reliable prediction of the structures of protein–ligand complexes at a practically useful computational cost. Our strategy allows treating this problem in full atomistic detail and in a computationally efficient manner and enhances the predictive power of IFD methods. We significantly increase the accuracy of the underlying IFD protocol across a large data set comprising 42 different ligand–receptor systems. We expect this approach to be of significant value in computationally driven drug design.},

The discrimination of various binding poses of ligand generated by docking is a great challenge not only to docking score functions but also to the relatively expensive free energy calculation methods. Here we systematically analyzed the stability of various ligand poses under molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. First, a data set of 120 complexes was built based on the typical physicochemical properties of drug-like ligands. Three potential binding poses (one correct pose and two decoys) were selected for each ligand from self-docking in addition to the experimental pose. Then, five independent MD simulations for each pose were performed with different initial velocities for the statistical analysis. Finally, the stabilities of ligand poses under MD were evaluated and compared with the native one from crystal structure. We found that about 94\% of the native poses were maintained stable during the simulations, which suggests that MD simulations are accurate enough to judge most experimental binding poses as stable properly. Interestingly, incorrect decoy poses were maintained much less and 38–44\% of decoys could be excluded just by performing equilibrium MD simulations, though 56–62\% of decoys were stable. The computationally-heavy binding free energy calculation can be performed only for these survived poses.},

Many studies have assessed the success rate of programs in self-docking tests, whereby a ligand is docked into the protein structure from which it was extracted. Cross-docking, or using a protein structure from a complex containing a different ligand, provides a more realistic assessment of a docking program's ability to reproduce X-ray results. In this work, cross-docking was performed with CDocker, Fred, and Rocs using multiple X-ray structures for eight proteins (two kinases, one nuclear hormone receptor, one serine protease, two metalloproteases, and two phosphodiesterases). While average cross-docking accuracy is not encouraging, it is shown that using the protein structure from the complex that contains the bound ligand most similar to the docked ligand increases docking accuracy for all methods (“similarity selection”). Identifying the most successful protein conformer (“best selection”) and similarity selection substantially reduce the difference between self-docking and average cross-docking accuracy. We identify universal predictors of docking accuracy (i.e., showing consistent behavior across most protein−method combinations), and show that models for predicting docking accuracy built using these parameters can be used to select the most appropriate docking method.},

	abstract = {Docking has become an indispensable approach in drug discovery research to predict the binding mode of a ligand. One great challenge in docking is to efficiently refine the correct pose from various putative docking poses through scoring functions. We recently examined the stability of self-docking poses under molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and showed that equilibrium MD simulations have some capability to discriminate between correct and decoy poses. Here, we have extended our previous work to cross-docking studies for practical applications. Three target proteins (thrombin, heat shock protein 90-alpha, and cyclin-dependent kinase 2) of pharmaceutical interest were selected. Three comparable poses (one correct pose and two decoys) for each ligand were then selected from the docking poses. To obtain the docking poses for the three target proteins, we used three different protocols, namely: normal docking, induced fit docking (IFD), and IFD against the homology model. Finally, five parallel MD equilibrium runs were performed on each pose for the statistical analysis. The results showed that the correct poses were generally more stable than the decoy poses under MD. The discrimination capability of MD depends on the strategy. The safest way was to judge a pose as being stable if any one run among five parallel runs was stable under MD. In this case, 95\% of the correct poses were retained under MD, and about 25–44\% of the decoys could be excluded by the simulations for all cases. On the other hand, if we judge a pose as being stable when any two or three runs were stable, with the risk of incorrectly excluding some correct poses, approximately 31–53\% or 39–56\% of the two decoys could be excluded by MD, respectively. Our results suggest that simple equilibrium simulations can serve as an effective filter to exclude decoy poses that cannot be distinguished by docking scores from the computationally expensive free-energy calculations.},

In the last decade, the advancements in computational biology, nuclear magnetic resonance including paramagnetic relaxation enhancement, and fluorescence-based ensemble/single-molecule techniques have shown that biological molecules (proteins, DNAs and RNAs) fluctuate under equilibrium conditions. The conformational and energetic spaces that these fluctuations explore likely contain active conformations that are critical for their function. More interestingly, these fluctuations can respond actively to external cues, which introduces layers of tight regulation on the biological processes that they dictate. A growing number of studies have suggested that conformational dynamics of proteins govern their role in regulating biological functions, examples of this regulation can be found in signal transduction, molecular recognition, apoptosis, protein / ion / other molecules translocation and gene expression. On the experimental side, the technical advances have offered deep insights into the conformational motions of a number of proteins. These studies greatly enrich our knowledge of the interplay between structure and function. On the theoretical side, novel approaches and detailed computational simulations have provided powerful tools in the study of enzyme catalysis, protein / drug design, protein / ion / other molecule translocation and protein folding/aggregation, to name but a few. This work contains detailed information, not only on the conformational motions of biological systems, but also on the potential governing forces of conformational dynamics (transient interactions, chemical and physical origins, thermodynamic properties). New developments in computational simulations will greatly enhance our understanding of how these molecules function in various biological events.},

The backbone flexibility was described in terms of order parameters and correlation times, commonly used in the NMR relaxation analysis. Special attention was paid to the effect of conformational changes on the nanosecond time scale. Time-dependent order parameters were determined in order to separate motions occurring on different time scales. As an alternative approach, slow conformational changes were identified from the backbone torsion angle variances, and “conformationally filtered” order parameters were calculated for well-defined conformation states. A comparison of the data obtained for the free and pheromone-bound protein showed that some residues are more rigid in the bound form, but a larger portion of the protein becomes more flexible upon the pheromone binding. This finding is in general agreement with the NMR results. The higher flexibility observed on the fast (fs−ps) time scale was typically observed for the residues exhibiting higher conformational freedom on the ns time scale. An inspection of the hydrogen bond network provided a structural explanation for the flexibility differences between the free and pheromone-bound proteins in the simulations.},

	abstract = {Innovative algorithms have been developed during the past decade for simulating Newtonian physics for macromolecules. A major goal is alleviation of the severe requirement that the integration timestep be small enough to resolve the fastest components of the motion and thus guarantee numerical stability. This timestep problem is challenging if strictly faster methods with the same all-atom resolution at small timesteps are sought. Mathematical techniques that have worked well in other multiple-timescale contexts—where the fast motions are rapidly decaying or largely decoupled from others—have not been as successful for biomolecules, where vibrational coupling is strong. This review examines general issues that limit the timestep and describes available methods (constrained, reduced-variable, implicit, symplecttic, multiple-timestep, and normal-mode-based schemes). A section compares results of selected integrators for a model dipeptide, assessing physical and numerical performance. Included is our dual timestep method LN, which relies on an approximate linearization of the equations of motion every Δt interval (5 fs or less), the solution of which is obtained by explicit integration at the inner timestep Δτ (e.g., 0.5 fs). LN is computationally competitive, providing 4–5 speedup factors, and results are in good agreement, in comparison to 0.5 fs trajectories. These collective algorithmic efforts help fill the gap between the time range that can be simulated and the timespans of major biological interest (milliseconds and longer). Still, only a hierarchy of models and methods, along with experimentational improvements, will ultimately give theoretical modeling the status of partner with experiment.},

	abstract = {To meet the challenge of modeling the conformational dynamics of biological macromolecules over long time scales, much recent effort has been devoted to constructing stochastic kinetic models, often in the form of discrete-state Markov models, from short molecular dynamics simulations. To construct useful models that faithfully represent dynamics at the time scales of interest, it is necessary to decompose configuration space into a set of kinetically metastable states. Previous attempts to define these states have relied upon either prior knowledge of the slow degrees of freedom or on the application of conformational clustering techniques which assume that conformationally distinct clusters are also kinetically distinct. Here, we present a first version of an automatic algorithm for the discovery of kinetically metastable states that is generally applicable to solvated macromolecules. Given molecular dynamics trajectories initiated from a well-defined starting distribution, the algorithm discovers long lived, kinetically metastable states through successive iterations of partitioning and aggregating conformation space into kinetically related regions.

NMR spectroscopy allows the measurement of generalized order parameters that provide an atomistic description of picosecond and nanosecond fluctuations in protein structure. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation provides a complementary approach to the study of protein dynamics on similar time scales. Comparisons between NMR spectroscopy and MD simulations can be used to interpret experimental results and to improve the quality of simulation-related force fields and integration methods. However, apparent systematic discrepancies between order parameters extracted from simulations and experiments are common, particularly for elements of noncanonical secondary structure. In this paper, results from a 1.2 μs explicit solvent MD simulation of the protein ubiquitin are compared with previously determined backbone order parameters derived from NMR relaxation experiments [Tjandra, N.; Feller, S. E.; Pastor, R. W.; Bax, A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 12562−12566]. The simulation reveals fluctuations in three loop regions that occur on time scales comparable to or longer than that of the overall rotational diffusion of ubiquitin and whose effects would not be apparent in experimentally derived order parameters. A coupled analysis of internal and overall motion yields simulated order parameters substantially closer to the experimentally determined values than is the case for a conventional analysis of internal motion alone. Improved agreement between simulation and experiment also is encouraging from the viewpoint of assessing the accuracy of long MD simulations.},

Numerous roles of EETs in regulatory biology now are clear, and the value of sEH inhibition in various animal models of disease has been demonstrated.

Recent findings suggest that the EHs as a family represent novel drug discovery targets for regulation of blood pressure, inflammation, cancer progression, and the onset of several other diseases. Knowledge of the EH mechanism provides a solid foundation for the rational design of inhibitors, and this review summarizes the current understanding of the catalytic mechanism of the EHs.

Here, we present an overview of the history and current state of research on epoxide hydrolases, specifically focusing on sEHs. In doing so, we start with the translational project studying the metabolism of the insect juvenile hormone mimic R-20458 [(E)-6,7-epoxy-1-(4-ethylphenoxy)-3,7-dimethyl-2-octene], which led to the identification of the mammalian sEH. Further investigation of this enzyme and its substrates, including the epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, led to insight into mechanisms of inflammation, chronic and neuropathic pain, angiogenesis, and other physiologic processes. This basic knowledge in turn led to the development of potent inhibitors of the sEH that are promising therapeutics for pain, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, arthritis, and other disorders.},

One example from this class of algorithms is the Robust Perron Cluster Analysis (PCCA+), which delivers a fuzzy clustering. Originally developed for clustering the state space of Markov chains, the method became popular as a versatile tool for general data classification problems. The robustness of PCCA+, however, cannot be explained by previous perturbation results, because the matrices in typical applications do not comply with the two main requirements: reversibility and nearly decomposability. We therefore demonstrate in this paper that PCCA+ always delivers an optimal fuzzy clustering for nearly uncoupled, not necessarily reversible, Markov chains with transition states.},

	abstract = {A goal in the kinetic characterization of a macromolecular system is the description of its slow relaxation processes via (i) identification of the structural changes involved in these processes and (ii) estimation of the rates or timescales at which these slow processes occur. Most of the approaches to this task, including Markov models, master-equation models, and kinetic network models, start by discretizing the high-dimensional state space and then characterize relaxation processes in terms of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a discrete transition matrix. The practical success of such an approach depends very much on the ability to finely discretize the slow order parameters. How can this task be achieved in a high-dimensional configuration space without relying on subjective guesses of the slow order parameters? In this paper, we use the variational principle of conformation dynamics to derive an optimal way of identifying the “slow subspace” of a large set of prior order parameters – either generic internal coordinates or a user-defined set of parameters. Using a variational formulation of conformational dynamics, it is shown that an existing method—the time-lagged independent component analysis—provides the optional solution to this problem. In addition, optimal indicators—order parameters indicating the progress of the slow transitions and thus may serve as reaction coordinates—are readily identified. We demonstrate that the slow subspace is well suited to construct accurate kinetic models of two sets of molecular dynamics simulations, the 6-residue fluorescent peptide MR121-GSGSW and the 30-residue intrinsically disordered peptide kinase inducible domain (KID). The identified optimal indicators reveal the structural changes associated with the slow processes of the molecular system under analysis.},

Here, we further advance simulation accuracy by improving the amino acid side-chain torsion potentials of the Amber ff99SB force field. First, we used simulations of model alpha-helical systems to identify the four residue types whose rotamer distribution differed the most from expectations based on Protein Data Bank statistics. Second, we optimized the side-chain torsion potentials of these residues to match new, high-level quantum-mechanical calculations. Finally, we used microsecond-timescale MD simulations in explicit solvent to validate the resulting force field against a large set of experimental NMR measurements that directly probe side-chain conformations.

	abstract = {We present the first global parameterization and validation of a novel charge model, called AM1-BCC, which quickly and efficiently generates high-quality atomic charges for computer simulations of organic molecules in polar media. The goal of the charge model is to produce atomic charges that emulate the HF/6-31G* electrostatic potential (ESP) of a molecule. Underlying electronic structure features, including formal charge and electron delocalization, are first captured by AM1 population charges; simple additive bond charge corrections (BCCs) are then applied to these AM1 atomic charges to produce the AM1-BCC charges. The parameterization of BCCs was carried out by fitting to the HF/6-31G* ESP of a training set of {\textgreater}2700 molecules. Most organic functional groups and their combinations were sampled, as well as an extensive variety of cyclic and fused bicyclic heteroaryl systems. The resulting BCC parameters allow the AM1-BCC charging scheme to handle virtually all types of organic compounds listed in The Merck Index and the NCI Database. Validation of the model was done through comparisons of hydrogen-bonded dimer energies and relative free energies of solvation using AM1-BCC charges in conjunction with the 1994 Cornell et al. forcefield for AMBER.13 Homo- and hetero-dimer hydrogen-bond energies of a diverse set of organic molecules were reproduced to within 0.95 kcal/mol RMS deviation from the ab initio values, and for DNA dimers the energies were within 0.9 kcal/mol RMS deviation from ab initio values. The calculated relative free energies of solvation for a diverse set of monofunctional isosteres were reproduced to within 0.69 kcal/mol of experiment. In all these validation tests, AMBER with the AM1-BCC charge model maintained a correlation coefficient above 0.96. Thus, the parameters presented here for use with the AM1-BCC method present a fast, accurate, and robust alternative to HF/6-31G* ESP-fit charges for general use with the AMBER force field in computer simulations involving organic small molecules. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We present new algorithms that allow pKa shifts due to inductive (i.e., covalently coupled) intraligand interactions, as well as noncovalently coupled interligand interactions in multiligand complexes, to be included in the prediction. The number of different ligand chemical groups that are automatically recognized has been increased to 18, and the general implementation has been changed so that new functional groups can be added easily by the user, aided by a new and more general protonation scheme. Except for a few cases, the new algorithms in PROPKA3.1 are found to yield results similar to or better than those obtained with PROPKA2.0 (Bas et al. Proteins: Struct., Funct., Bioinf.2008, 73, 765–783). Finally, we present a novel algorithm that identifies noncovalently coupled ionizable groups, where pKa prediction may be especially difficult. This is a general improvement to PROPKA and is applied to proteins with and without ligands.},

APBS addresses the three key technology challenges for understanding solvation and electrostatics in biomedical applications: accurate and efficient models for biomolecular solvation and electrostatics, robust and scalable software for applying those theories to biomolecular systems, and mechanisms for sharing and analyzing biomolecular electrostatics data in the scientific community. To address new research applications and advancing computational capabilities, we have continually updated APBS and its suite of accompanying software since its release in 2001. In this article, we discuss the models and capabilities that have recently been implemented within the APBS software package including a Poisson–Boltzmann analytical and a semi-analytical solver, an optimized boundary element solver, a geometry-based geometric flow solvation model, a graph theory-based algorithm for determining pKa values, and an improved web-based visualization tool for viewing electrostatics.},

The algorithm consists of three phases: assembly of an initial 3D structure from a library of fragments; exhaustive enumeration of all rotatable torsions using values drawn from a knowledge-based list of angles, thereby generating a large set of conformations; and sampling of this set by geometric and energy criteria. Validation of conformer generators like OMEGA has often been undertaken by comparing computed conformer sets to experimental molecular conformations from crystallography, usually from the Protein Databank (PDB). Such an approach is fraught with difficulty due to the systematic problems with small molecule structures in the PDB. Methods are presented to identify a diverse set of small molecule structures from cocomplexes in the PDB that has maximal reliability. A challenging set of 197 high quality, carefully selected ligand structures from well-solved models was obtained using these methods. This set will provide a sound basis for comparison and validation of conformer generators in the future. Validation results from this set are compared to the results using structures of a set of druglike molecules extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). OMEGA is found to perform very well in reproducing the crystallographic conformations from both these data sets using two complementary metrics of success.},

However, the estimation, validation, and analysis of such models is far from trivial and involves sophisticated and often numerically sensitive methods. In this work we present the open-source Python package PyEMMA (http://pyemma.org) that provides accurate and efficient algorithms for kinetic model construction. PyEMMA can read all common molecular dynamics data formats, helps in the selection of input features, provides easy access to dimension reduction algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA) and time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA) and clustering algorithms such as k-means, and contains estimators for MSMs, hidden Markov models, and several other models. Systematic model validation and error calculation methods are provided. PyEMMA offers a wealth of analysis functions such that the user can conveniently compute molecular observables of interest. We have derived a systematic and accurate way to coarse-grain MSMs to few states and to illustrate the structures of the metastable states of the system. Plotting functions to produce a manuscript-ready presentation of the results are available. In this work, we demonstrate the features of the software and show new methodological concepts and results produced by PyEMMA.},

Followed by a joint dose–response analysis to confirm the hits, the identified actives were then effectively triaged by a structure-based hit-classification approach to three prioritized series. Two distinct scaffolds were identified as tractable starting points for potential lead chemistry work. The oxoindoline series bind at the right-hand side of the active-site pocket with hydrogen bonds to the protein. The 2-phenylbenzimidazole-4-sulfonamide series bind at the central channel with significant induced fit, which has not been previously reported. On the basis of the encouraging initial results, we envision that a new lead series with improved properties could be generated if a vector is found that could merge the cyclohexyl functionality of the oxoindoline series with the trifluoromethyl moiety of the 2-phenylbenzimidazole-4-sulfonamide series.},

	abstract = {Docking has become an indispensable approach in drug discovery research to predict the binding mode of a ligand. One great challenge in docking is to efficiently refine the correct pose from various putative docking poses through scoring functions. We recently examined the stability of self-docking poses under molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and showed that equilibrium MD simulations have some capability to discriminate between correct and decoy poses. Here, we have extended our previous work to cross-docking studies for practical applications. Three target proteins (thrombin, heat shock protein 90-alpha, and cyclin-dependent kinase 2) of pharmaceutical interest were selected. Three comparable poses (one correct pose and two decoys) for each ligand were then selected from the docking poses. To obtain the docking poses for the three target proteins, we used three different protocols, namely: normal docking, induced fit docking (IFD), and IFD against the homology model. Finally, five parallel MD equilibrium runs were performed on each pose for the statistical analysis. The results showed that the correct poses were generally more stable than the decoy poses under MD. The discrimination capability of MD depends on the strategy. The safest way was to judge a pose as being stable if any one run among five parallel runs was stable under MD. In this case, 95\% of the correct poses were retained under MD, and about 25–44\% of the decoys could be excluded by the simulations for all cases. On the other hand, if we judge a pose as being stable when any two or three runs were stable, with the risk of incorrectly excluding some correct poses, approximately 31–53\% or 39–56\% of the two decoys could be excluded by MD, respectively. Our results suggest that simple equilibrium simulations can serve as an effective filter to exclude decoy poses that cannot be distinguished by docking scores from the computationally expensive free-energy calculations.},

	abstract = {Accurate ligand-protein binding affinity prediction, for a set of similar binders, is a major challenge in the lead optimization stage in drug development. In general, docking and scoring functions perform unsatisfactorily in this application. Docking calculations, followed by molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations can be applied to improve the predictions. However, for targets with large, flexible binding sites, with no experimentally determined binding modes for a set of ligands, insufficient sampling can decrease the accuracy of the free energy calculations. Cytochrome P450s, a protein family of major importance for drug metabolism, is an example of a challenging target for binding affinity predictions. As a result, the choice of starting structure from the docking solutions becomes crucial. In this study, an iterative scheme is introduced that includes multiple independent molecular dynamics simulations to obtain weighted ensemble averages to be used in the linear interaction energy method. The proposed scheme makes the initial pose selection less crucial for further simulation, as it automatically calculates the relative weights of the various poses. It also properly takes into account the possibility that multiple binding modes contribute similarly to the overall affinity, or of similar compounds occupying very different poses. The method was applied to a set of 12 compounds binding to cytochrome P450 2C9 and it displayed a root mean-square error of 2.9 kJ/mol.},

	abstract = {Estimating the correct binding modes of ligands in protein–ligand complexes is crucial not only in the drug discovery process but also for elucidating potential toxicity mechanisms. In the current paper, we propose a computational modeling workflow using the combination of docking, classical molecular dynamics (cMD), accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) and free-energy perturbation (FEP+ protocol) for identification of possible ligand binding modes. It was applied for investigation of selected perfluorocarboxyl acids (PFCAs) in the PPARγ nuclear receptor. Although both regular and induced fit docking failed to reproduce the experimentally determined binding mode of the ligands when docked into a non-native X-ray structure, cMD and aMD simulations successfully identified the most probable binding conformations. Moreover, multiple binding modes were identified for all of these compounds and the shorter-chain PFCAs continuously moved between a few energetically favorable binding conformations. On the basis of MD predictions of binding conformations, we applied the default and also redesigned FEP+ sampling protocols, which accurately reproduced experimental differences in the binding energies. Thus, the preliminary MD simulations can also provide helpful information about correct setup of the FEP+ calculations. These results show that the PFCA binding modes were accurately predicted and that the FEP+ protocol can be used to estimate free energies of binding of flexible ligands that are not typical druglike compounds. Our in silico workflow revealed the specific ligand–residue interactions within the ligand binding domain and the main characteristics of the PFCAs, and it was concluded that these compounds are week PPARγ partial agonists. This work also suggests a common pipeline for identification of ligand binding modes, ligand–protein dynamics description, and relative free-energy calculations.},

	abstract = {Approaches which start from a study of the interaction of very simple molecules (fragments) with the protein target are proving to be valuable additions to drug design. Fragment-based screening allows the complementarity between a protein active site and drug-like molecules to be rapidly and effectively explored, using structural methods. Recent improvements in the intensities of laboratory X-ray sources permits the collection of greater amounts of high-quality diffraction data and have been matched by developments in automation, crystallisation and data analysis. Developments in NMR screening, including the use of cryogenically cooled NMR probes and 19F-containing reporter molecules have expanded the scope of this technique, while increasing the availability of binding site and quantitative affinity data for the fragments. Application of these methods has led to a greater knowledge of the chemical variety, structural features and energetics of protein–fragment interactions. While fragment-based screening has already been shown to reduce the timescales of the drug discovery process, a more detailed characterisation of fragment screening hits can reveal unexpected similarities between fragment chemotypes and protein active sites leading to improved understanding of the pharmacophores and the re-use of this information against other protein targets.},

	abstract = {Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) has emerged in the past decade as a powerful tool for discovering drug leads. The approach first identifies starting points: very small molecules (fragments) that are about half the size of typical drugs. These fragments are then expanded or linked together to generate drug leads. Although the origins of the technique date back some 30 years, it was only in the mid-1990s that experimental techniques became sufficiently sensitive and rapid for the concept to be become practical. Since that time, the field has exploded: FBDD has played a role in discovery of at least 18 drugs that have entered the clinic, and practitioners of FBDD can be found throughout the world in both academia and industry. Literally dozens of reviews have been published on various aspects of FBDD or on the field as a whole, as have three books (Jahnke and Erlanson, Fragment-based approaches in drug discovery, 2006; Zartler and Shapiro, Fragment-based drug discovery: a practical approach, 2008; Kuo, Fragment based drug design: tools, practical approaches, and examples, 2011). However, this chapter will assume that the reader is approaching the field with little prior knowledge. It will introduce some of the key concepts, set the stage for the chapters to follow, and demonstrate how X-ray crystallography plays a central role in fragment identification and advancement.},

	abstract = {Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) represents a change in strategy from the screening of molecules with higher molecular weights and physical properties more akin to fully drug-like compounds, to the screening of smaller, less complex molecules. This is because it has been recognised that fragment hit molecules can be efficiently grown and optimised into leads, particularly after the binding mode to the target protein has been first determined by 3D structural elucidation, e.g. by NMR or X-ray crystallography. Several studies have shown that medicinal chemistry optimisation of an already drug-like hit or lead compound can result in a final compound with too high molecular weight and lipophilicity. The evolution of a lower molecular weight fragment hit therefore represents an attractive alternative approach to optimisation as it allows better control of compound properties. Computational chemistry can play an important role both prior to a fragment screen, in producing a target focussed fragment library, and post-screening in the evolution of a drug-like molecule from a fragment hit, both with and without the available fragment-target co-complex structure. We will review many of the current developments in the area and illustrate with some recent examples from successful FBDD discovery projects that we have conducted.},

	abstract = {Human serum albumin possesses multiple binding sites and transports a wide range of ligands that include the anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen. A complete map of the binding sites of ibuprofen in albumin is difficult to obtain in traditional experiments, because of the structural adaptability of this protein in accommodating small ligands. In this work, we provide a set of predictions covering the geometry, affinity of binding and protonation state for the pharmaceutically most active form (S– isomer) of ibuprofen to albumin, by using absolute binding free energy calculations in combination with classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and molecular docking. The most favorable binding modes correctly reproduce several experimentally identified binding locations, which include the two Sudlow's drug sites (DS2 and DS1) and the fatty acid binding sites 6 and 2 (FA6 and FA2). Previously unknown details of the binding conformations were revealed for some of them, and formerly undetected binding modes were found in other protein sites. The calculated binding affinities exhibit trends which seem to agree with the available experimental data, and drastically degrade when the ligand is modeled in a protonated (neutral) state, indicating that ibuprofen associates with albumin preferentially in its charged form. These findings provide a detailed description of the binding of ibuprofen, help to explain a wide range of results reported in the literature in the last decades, and demonstrate the possibility of using simulation methods to predict ligand binding to albumin., Alchemical free energy methods can identify favored binding modes of a ligand within a large protein with multiple binding sites,},

Alchemical free energy calculations seek to change that by providing rigorous binding free energies from molecular simulations. Given adequate sampling and an accurate enough force field, these techniques yield accurate free energy estimates. Recent innovations in alchemical techniques have sparked a resurgence of interest in these calculations. Still, many obstacles stand in the way of their routine application in a drug discovery context, including the one we focus on here, sampling. Sampling of binding modes poses a particular challenge as binding modes are often separated by large energy barriers, leading to slow transitions. Binding modes are difficult to predict, and in some cases multiple binding modes may contribute to binding. In view of these hurdles, we present a framework for dealing carefully with uncertainty in binding mode or conformation in the context of free energy calculations. With careful sampling, free energy techniques show considerable promise for aiding drug discovery.},

    abstract = { Binding free energy calculations based on molecular simulations provide predicted affinities for biomolecular complexes. These calculations begin with a detailed description of a system, including its chemical composition and the interactions among its components. Simulations of the system are then used to compute thermodynamic information, such as binding affinities. Because of their promise for guiding molecular design, these calculations have recently begun to see widespread applications in early-stage drug discovery. However, many hurdles remain in making them a robust and reliable tool. In this review, we highlight key challenges of these calculations, discuss some examples of these challenges, and call for the designation of standard community benchmark test systems that will help the research community generate and evaluate progress. In our view, progress will require careful assessment and evaluation of new methods, force fields, and modeling innovations on well-characterized benchmark systems, and we lay out our vision for how this can be achieved. }

abstract ={Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful tool for studying the equilibrium properties of matter. In complex condensed-phase systems, however, it is difficult to design Monte Carlo moves with high acceptance probabilities that also rapidly sample uncorrelated configurations. Here, we introduce a new class of moves based on nonequilibrium dynamics: Candidate configurations are generated through a finite-time process in which a system is actively driven out of equilibrium, and accepted with criteria that preserve the equilibrium distribution. The acceptance rule is similar to the Metropolis acceptance probability, but related to the nonequilibrium work rather than the instantaneous energy difference. Our method is applicable to sampling from both a single thermodynamic state or a mixture of thermodynamic states, and allows both coordinates and thermodynamic parameters to be driven in nonequilibrium proposals. Whereas generating finite-time switching trajectories incurs an additional cost, driving some degrees of freedom while allowing others to evolve naturally can lead to large enhancements in acceptance probabilities, greatly reducing structural correlation times. Using nonequilibrium driven processes vastly expands the repertoire of useful Monte Carlo proposals in simulations of dense solvated systems.},

   abstract ={Conformational change in protein–ligand complexes is widely modeled, but the protein accommodation expected on binding a congeneric series of ligands has received less attention. Given their use in medicinal chemistry, there are surprisingly few substantial series of congeneric ligand complexes in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Here we determine the structures of eight alkyl benzenes, in single-methylene increases from benzene to n-hexylbenzene, bound to an enclosed cavity in T4 lysozyme. The volume of the apo cavity suffices to accommodate benzene but, even with toluene, larger cavity conformations become observable in the electron density, and over the series two other major conformations are observed. These involve discrete changes in main-chain conformation, expanding the site; few continuous changes in the site are observed. In most structures, two discrete protein conformations are observed simultaneously, and energetic considerations suggest that these conformations are low in energy relative to the ground state. An analysis of 121 lysozyme cavity structures in the PDB finds that these three conformations dominate the previously determined structures, largely modeled in a single conformation. An investigation of the few congeneric series in the PDB suggests that discrete changes are common adaptations to a series of growing ligands. The discrete, but relatively few, conformational states observed here, and their energetic accessibility, may have implications for anticipating protein conformational change in ligand design.},

abstract ={An innovative replica exchange (parallel tempering) method called replica exchange with solute tempering (REST) for the efficient sampling of aqueous protein solutions is presented here. The method bypasses the poor scaling with system size of standard replica exchange and thus reduces the number of replicas (parallel processes) that must be used. This reduction is accomplished by deforming the Hamiltonian function for each replica in such a way that the acceptance probability for the exchange of replica configurations does not depend on the number of explicit water molecules in the system. For proof of concept, REST is compared with standard replica exchange for an alanine dipeptide molecule in water. The comparisons confirm that REST greatly reduces the number of CPUs required by regular replica exchange and increases the sampling efficiency. This method reduces the CPU time required for calculating thermodynamic averages and for the ab initio folding of proteins in explicit water.},

abstract ={We apply a free energy perturbation simulation method, free energy perturbation/replica exchange with solute tempering, to two modifications of protein–ligand complexes that lead to significant conformational changes, the first in the protein and the second in the ligand. The approach is shown to facilitate sampling in these challenging cases where high free energy barriers separate the initial and final conformations and leads to superior convergence of the free energy as demonstrated both by consistency of the results (independence from the starting conformation) and agreement with experimental binding affinity data. The second case, consisting of two neutral thrombin ligands that are taken from a recent medicinal chemistry program for this interesting pharmaceutical target, is of particular significance in that it demonstrates that good results can be obtained for large, complex ligands, as opposed to relatively simple model systems. To achieve quantitative agreement with experiment in the thrombin case, a next generation force field, Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations 2.0, is required, which provides superior charges and torsional parameters as compared to earlier alternatives.},

abstract="Alchemical free energy calculations hold increasing promise as an aid to drug discovery efforts. However, applications of these techniques in discovery projects have been relatively few, partly because of the difficulty of planning and setting up calculations. Here, we introduce lead optimization mapper, LOMAP, an automated algorithm to plan efficient relative free energy calculations between potential ligands within a substantial library of perhaps hundreds of compounds. In this approach, ligands are first grouped by structural similarity primarily based on the size of a (loosely defined) maximal common substructure, and then calculations are planned within and between sets of structurally related compounds. An emphasis is placed on ensuring that relative free energies can be obtained between any pair of compounds without combining the results of too many different relative free energy calculations (to avoid accumulation of error) and by providing some redundancy to allow for the possibility of error and consistency checking and provide some insight into when results can be expected to be unreliable. The algorithm is discussed in detail and a Python implementation, based on both Schr{\"o}dinger's and OpenEye's APIs, has been made available freely under the BSD license.",

abstract="Structure-based virtual screening plays an important role in drug discovery and complements other screening approaches. In general, protein crystal structures are prepared prior to docking in order to add hydrogen atoms, optimize hydrogen bonds, remove atomic clashes, and perform other operations that are not part of the x-ray crystal structure refinement process. In addition, ligands must be prepared to create 3-dimensional geometries, assign proper bond orders, and generate accessible tautomer and ionization states prior to virtual screening. While the prerequisite for proper system preparation is generally accepted in the field, an extensive study of the preparation steps and their effect on virtual screening enrichments has not been performed. In this work, we systematically explore each of the steps involved in preparing a system for virtual screening. We first explore a large number of parameters using the Glide validation set of 36 crystal structures and 1,000 decoys. We then apply a subset of protocols to the DUD database. We show that database enrichment is improved with proper preparation and that neglecting certain steps of the preparation process produces a systematic degradation in enrichments, which can be large for some targets. We provide examples illustrating the structural changes introduced by the preparation that impact database enrichment. While the work presented here was performed with the Protein Preparation Wizard and Glide, the insights and guidance are expected to be generalizable to structure-based virtual screening with other docking methods.",

abstract="Dynamic disorder of the lipid bilayer presents a challenge for establishing structure--function relationships in membranous systems. The resulting structural heterogeneity is especially evident for peripheral and spontaneously inserting membrane proteins, which are not constrained by the well-defined transmembrane topology and exert their action in the context of intimate interaction with lipids. Here, we propose a concerted approach combining depth-dependent fluorescence quenching with Molecular Dynamics simulation to decipher dynamic interactions of membrane proteins with the lipid bilayers. We apply this approach to characterize membrane-mediated action of the diphtheria toxin translocation domain. First, we use a combination of the steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy to characterize bilayer penetration of the NBD probe selectively attached to different sites of the protein into membranes containing lipid-attached nitroxyl quenching groups. The constructed quenching profiles are analyzed with the Distribution Analysis methodology allowing for accurate determination of transverse distribution of the probe. The results obtained for 12 NBD-labeled single-Cys mutants are consistent with the so-called Open-Channel topology model. The experimentally determined quenching profiles for labeling sites corresponding to L350, N373, and P378 were used as initial constraints for positioning TH8--9 hairpin into the lipid bilayer for Molecular Dynamics simulation. Finally, we used alchemical free energy calculations to characterize protonation of E362 in soluble translocation domain and membrane-inserted conformation of its TH8--9 fragment. Our results indicate that membrane partitioning of the neutral E362 is more favorable energetically (by {\textasciitilde}{\thinspace}6Â kcal/mol), but causes stronger perturbation of the bilayer, than the charged E362.",

Structure-based methods are in principle analogous to high-throughput screening in that both target and ligand structure information is imperative. Structure-based approaches include ligand docking, pharmacophore, and ligand design methods. The article discusses theory behind the most important methods and recent successful applications. Ligand-based methods use only ligand information for predicting activity depending on its similarity/dissimilarity to previously known active ligands. We review widely used ligand-based methods such as ligand-based pharmacophores, molecular descriptors, and quantitative structure-activity relationships. In addition, important tools such as target/ligand data bases, homology modeling, ligand fingerprint methods, etc., necessary for successful implementation of various computer-aided drug discovery/design methods in a drug discovery campaign are discussed. Finally, computational methods for toxicity prediction and optimization for favorable physiologic properties are discussed with successful examples from literature.},

	abstract = {We describe here a general Amber force field (GAFF) for organic molecules. GAFF is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force fields for proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement of 0.26 A, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 A) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44 A, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to MP2/6-31G* results. The RMS of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 A and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 A and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The RMS error in relative energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. GAFF can be applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion, making it suitable for rational drug design and database searching.},

	abstract = {We present the first global parameterization and validation of a novel charge model, called AM1-BCC, which quickly and efficiently generates high-quality atomic charges for computer simulations of organic molecules in polar media. The goal of the charge model is to produce atomic charges that emulate the HF/6-31G* electrostatic potential (ESP) of a molecule. Underlying electronic structure features, including formal charge and electron delocalization, are first captured by AM1 population charges; simple additive bond charge corrections (BCCs) are then applied to these AM1 atomic charges to produce the AM1-BCC charges. The parameterization of BCCs was carried out by fitting to the HF/6-31G* ESP of a training set of {\textgreater}2700 molecules. Most organic functional groups and their combinations were sampled, as well as an extensive variety of cyclic and fused bicyclic heteroaryl systems. The resulting BCC parameters allow the AM1-BCC charging scheme to handle virtually all types of organic compounds listed in The Merck Index and the NCI Database. Validation of the model was done through comparisons of hydrogen-bonded dimer energies and relative free energies of solvation using AM1-BCC charges in conjunction with the 1994 Cornell et al. forcefield for AMBER.13 Homo- and hetero-dimer hydrogen-bond energies of a diverse set of organic molecules were reproduced to within 0.95 kcal/mol RMS deviation from the ab initio values, and for DNA dimers the energies were within 0.9 kcal/mol RMS deviation from ab initio values. The calculated relative free energies of solvation for a diverse set of monofunctional isosteres were reproduced to within 0.69 kcal/mol of experiment. In all these validation tests, AMBER with the AM1-BCC charge model maintained a correlation coefficient above 0.96. Thus, the parameters presented here for use with the AM1-BCC method present a fast, accurate, and robust alternative to HF/6-31G* ESP-fit charges for general use with the AMBER force field in computer simulations involving organic small molecules. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {The development and validation of a new knowledge-based scoring function (DrugScore) to describe the binding geometry of ligands in proteins is presented. It discriminates efficiently between well-docked ligand binding modes (root-mean-square deviation {\textless}2.0 Å with respect to a crystallographically determined reference complex) and those largely deviating from the native structure, e.g. generated by computer docking programs. Structural information is extracted from crystallographically determined protein-ligand complexes using ReLiBase and converted into distance-dependent pair-preferences and solvent-accessible surface (SAS) dependent singlet preferences for protein and ligand atoms. Definition of an appropriate reference state and accounting for inaccuracies inherently present in experimental data is required to achieve good predictive power. The sum of the pair preferences and the singlet preferences is calculated based on the 3D structure of protein-ligand binding modes generated by docking tools. For two test sets of 91 and 68 protein-ligand complexes, taken from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), the calculated score recognizes poses generated by FlexX deviating {\textless}2 Å from the crystal structure on rank 1 in three quarters of all possible cases. Compared to FlexX, this is a substantial improvement. For ligand geometries generated by DOCK, DrugScore is superior to the “chemical scoring” implemented into this tool, while comparable results are obtained using the “energy scoring” in DOCK. None of the presently known scoring functions achieves comparable power to extract binding modes in agreement with experiment. It is fast to compute, regards implicitly solvation and entropy contributions and produces correctly the geometry of directional interactions. Small deviations in the 3D structure are tolerated and, since only contacts to non-hydrogen atoms are regarded, it is independent from assumptions of protonation states.},

	abstract = {Molecular docking is the most frequently used computational method for studying the interactions between organic molecules and biological macromolecules. In this context, docking allows predicting the preferred pose of a ligand inside a receptor binding site. However, the selection of the “best” solution is not a trivial task, despite the widely accepted selection criterion that the best pose corresponds to the best energy score. Here, several rigid-target docking methods were evaluated on the same dataset with respect to their ability to reproduce crystallographic binding orientations, to test if the best energy score is a reliable criterion for selecting the best solution. For this, two experiments were performed: (A) to reconstruct the ligand-receptor complex by performing docking of the ligand in its own crystal structure receptor (defined as self-docking), and (B) to reconstruct the ligand-receptor complex by performing docking of the ligand in a crystal structure receptor that contains other ligand (defined as cross-docking). Root-mean square deviation (RMSD) was used to evaluate how different the obtained docking orientation is from the corresponding co-crystallized pose of the same ligand molecule. We found that docking score function is capable of predicting crystallographic binding orientations, but the best ranked solution according to the docking energy is not always the pose that reproduces the experimental binding orientation. This happened when self-docking was achieved, but it was critical in cross-docking. Taking into account that docking is typically used with predictive purposes, during cross-docking experiments, our results indicate that the best energy score is not a reliable criterion to select the best solution in common docking applications. It is strongly recommended to choose the best docking solution according to the scoring function along with additional structural criteria described for analogue ligands to assure the selection of a correct docking solution.},

	abstract = {Docking is one of the most commonly used techniques in drug design. It is used for both identifying correct poses of a ligand in the binding site of a protein as well as for the estimation of the strength of protein–ligand interaction. Because millions of compounds must be screened, before a suitable target for biological testing can be identified, all calculations should be done in a reasonable time frame. Thus, all programs currently in use exploit empirically based algorithms, avoiding systematic search of the conformational space. Similarly, the scoring is done using simple equations, which makes it possible to speed up the entire process. Therefore, docking results have to be verified by subsequent in vitro studies. The purpose of our work was to evaluate seven popular docking programs (Surflex, LigandFit, Glide, GOLD, FlexX, eHiTS, and AutoDock) on the extensive dataset composed of 1300 protein–ligands complexes from PDBbind 2007 database, where experimentally measured binding affinity values were also available. We compared independently the ability of proper posing [according to Root mean square deviation (or Root mean square distance) of predicted conformations versus the corresponding native one] and scoring (by calculating the correlation between docking score and ligand binding strength). To our knowledge, it is the first large-scale docking evaluation that covers both aspects of docking programs, that is, predicting ligand conformation and calculating the strength of its binding. More than 1000 protein–ligand pairs cover a wide range of different protein families and inhibitor classes. Our results clearly showed that the ligand binding conformation could be identified in most cases by using the existing software, yet we still observed the lack of universal scoring function for all types of molecules and protein families. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Since the performance of various docking routines varies considerably, depending on the target and the chemical nature of the ligand, we critically evaluated the performance of four frequently used programs – GOLD, AutoDock, Surflex-Dock, and FRED – for the docking of SERCA inhibitors based on the structures of thapsigargin, di-tert-butylhydroquinone, and cyclopiazonic acid. Evaluation criteria were docking accuracy using crystal structures as references, docking reproducibility, and correlation between docking scores and known bioactivities.

	abstract = {Docking is one of the most commonly used techniques in drug design. It is used for both identifying correct poses of a ligand in the binding site of a protein as well as for the estimation of the strength of protein–ligand interaction. Because millions of compounds must be screened, before a suitable target for biological testing can be identified, all calculations should be done in a reasonable time frame. Thus, all programs currently in use exploit empirically based algorithms, avoiding systematic search of the conformational space. Similarly, the scoring is done using simple equations, which makes it possible to speed up the entire process. Therefore, docking results have to be verified by subsequent in vitro studies. The purpose of our work was to evaluate seven popular docking programs (Surflex, LigandFit, Glide, GOLD, FlexX, eHiTS, and AutoDock) on the extensive dataset composed of 1300 protein–ligands complexes from PDBbind 2007 database, where experimentally measured binding affinity values were also available. We compared independently the ability of proper posing [according to Root mean square deviation (or Root mean square distance) of predicted conformations versus the corresponding native one] and scoring (by calculating the correlation between docking score and ligand binding strength). To our knowledge, it is the first large-scale docking evaluation that covers both aspects of docking programs, that is, predicting ligand conformation and calculating the strength of its binding. More than 1000 protein–ligand pairs cover a wide range of different protein families and inhibitor classes. Our results clearly showed that the ligand binding conformation could be identified in most cases by using the existing software, yet we still observed the lack of universal scoring function for all types of molecules and protein families. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

An evaluation of 10 docking programs and 37 scoring functions was conducted against eight proteins of seven protein types for three tasks:  binding mode prediction, virtual screening for lead identification, and rank-ordering by affinity for lead optimization. All of the docking programs were able to generate ligand conformations similar to crystallographically determined protein/ligand complex structures for at least one of the targets. However, scoring functions were less successful at distinguishing the crystallographic conformation from the set of docked poses. Docking programs identified active compounds from a pharmaceutically relevant pool of decoy compounds; however, no single program performed well for all of the targets. For prediction of compound affinity, none of the docking programs or scoring functions made a useful prediction of ligand binding affinity.},

In this paper, we report on the use of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and machine learning to study the binding mechanism of a transition state analogue (DADMe–immucillin-H) to the purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) enzyme. Microsecond-long MD simulations allow us to observe several binding events, following different dynamical routes and reaching diverse binding configurations. These simulations are used to estimate kinetic and thermodynamic quantities, such as kon and binding free energy, obtaining a good agreement with available experimental data. In addition, we advance a hypothesis for the slow-onset inhibition mechanism of DADMe–immucillin-H against PNP. Combining extensive MD simulations with machine learning algorithms could therefore be a fruitful approach for capturing key aspects of drug–target recognition and binding., 
Understanding the dynamics of enzyme-substrate complexation provides an insight into potential drugs, but intermediate states are difficult to observe experimentally. Here, the authors use simulations and machine learning to analyse the binding of transition state inhibitors to purine nucleoside phosphorylase.},

	abstract = {Ligand docking is a widely used tool for lead discovery and binding mode prediction based drug discovery. The greatest challenges in docking occur when the receptor significantly reorganizes upon small molecule binding, thereby requiring an induced fit docking (IFD) approach in which the receptor is allowed to move in order to bind to the ligand optimally. IFD methods have had some success but suffer from a lack of reliability. Complementing IFD with all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) is a straightforward solution in principle but not in practice due to the severe time scale limitations of MD. Here we introduce a metadynamics plus IFD strategy for accurate and reliable prediction of the structures of protein–ligand complexes at a practically useful computational cost. Our strategy allows treating this problem in full atomistic detail and in a computationally efficient manner and enhances the predictive power of IFD methods. We significantly increase the accuracy of the underlying IFD protocol across a large data set comprising 42 different ligand–receptor systems. We expect this approach to be of significant value in computationally driven drug design.},

The discrimination of various binding poses of ligand generated by docking is a great challenge not only to docking score functions but also to the relatively expensive free energy calculation methods. Here we systematically analyzed the stability of various ligand poses under molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. First, a data set of 120 complexes was built based on the typical physicochemical properties of drug-like ligands. Three potential binding poses (one correct pose and two decoys) were selected for each ligand from self-docking in addition to the experimental pose. Then, five independent MD simulations for each pose were performed with different initial velocities for the statistical analysis. Finally, the stabilities of ligand poses under MD were evaluated and compared with the native one from crystal structure. We found that about 94\% of the native poses were maintained stable during the simulations, which suggests that MD simulations are accurate enough to judge most experimental binding poses as stable properly. Interestingly, incorrect decoy poses were maintained much less and 38–44\% of decoys could be excluded just by performing equilibrium MD simulations, though 56–62\% of decoys were stable. The computationally-heavy binding free energy calculation can be performed only for these survived poses.},

Many studies have assessed the success rate of programs in self-docking tests, whereby a ligand is docked into the protein structure from which it was extracted. Cross-docking, or using a protein structure from a complex containing a different ligand, provides a more realistic assessment of a docking program's ability to reproduce X-ray results. In this work, cross-docking was performed with CDocker, Fred, and Rocs using multiple X-ray structures for eight proteins (two kinases, one nuclear hormone receptor, one serine protease, two metalloproteases, and two phosphodiesterases). While average cross-docking accuracy is not encouraging, it is shown that using the protein structure from the complex that contains the bound ligand most similar to the docked ligand increases docking accuracy for all methods (“similarity selection”). Identifying the most successful protein conformer (“best selection”) and similarity selection substantially reduce the difference between self-docking and average cross-docking accuracy. We identify universal predictors of docking accuracy (i.e., showing consistent behavior across most protein−method combinations), and show that models for predicting docking accuracy built using these parameters can be used to select the most appropriate docking method.},

	abstract = {Docking has become an indispensable approach in drug discovery research to predict the binding mode of a ligand. One great challenge in docking is to efficiently refine the correct pose from various putative docking poses through scoring functions. We recently examined the stability of self-docking poses under molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and showed that equilibrium MD simulations have some capability to discriminate between correct and decoy poses. Here, we have extended our previous work to cross-docking studies for practical applications. Three target proteins (thrombin, heat shock protein 90-alpha, and cyclin-dependent kinase 2) of pharmaceutical interest were selected. Three comparable poses (one correct pose and two decoys) for each ligand were then selected from the docking poses. To obtain the docking poses for the three target proteins, we used three different protocols, namely: normal docking, induced fit docking (IFD), and IFD against the homology model. Finally, five parallel MD equilibrium runs were performed on each pose for the statistical analysis. The results showed that the correct poses were generally more stable than the decoy poses under MD. The discrimination capability of MD depends on the strategy. The safest way was to judge a pose as being stable if any one run among five parallel runs was stable under MD. In this case, 95\% of the correct poses were retained under MD, and about 25–44\% of the decoys could be excluded by the simulations for all cases. On the other hand, if we judge a pose as being stable when any two or three runs were stable, with the risk of incorrectly excluding some correct poses, approximately 31–53\% or 39–56\% of the two decoys could be excluded by MD, respectively. Our results suggest that simple equilibrium simulations can serve as an effective filter to exclude decoy poses that cannot be distinguished by docking scores from the computationally expensive free-energy calculations.},

Antibiotics are a class of drugs with particularly strict property requirements for efficacy and safety. The development of novel antibiotics has slowed down so much that resistance has now evolved against every available antibiotic drug. Here we give an overview of fragment-based approaches in screening and lead discovery projects for new antibiotics. We discuss several successful hit-to-lead development examples.

The application of this technology for the fragment screening as well as the fragment evolution process with a specific modelling based design strategy is demonstrated for inhibitors of the protein kinase p38alpha. In a fragment screening approach seed fragments were identified which were then used to build compounds from the deep-pocket towards the hinge binding area of the protein kinase p38alpha based on a modelling approach. BIRB796 was used as a blueprint for the alignment of the fragments. The fragment evolution of these deep-pocket binding fragments towards the fully optimized inhibitor BIRB796 included the modulation of the residence time as well as the affinity. The goal of our study was to evaluate the robustness and efficiency of our novel fragment screening technology at high fragment concentrations, compare the screening data with biochemical activity data and to demonstrate the evolution of the hit fragments with fast kinetics, into slow kinetic inhibitors in an in silico approach.},

	abstract = {This book discusses how biological molecules exert their function and regulate biological processes, with a clear focus on how conformational dynamics of proteins are critical in this respect. In the last decade, the advancements in computational biology, nuclear magnetic resonance including paramagnetic relaxation enhancement, and fluorescence-based ensemble/single-molecule techniques have shown that biological molecules (proteins, DNAs and RNAs) fluctuate under equilibrium conditions. The conformational and energetic spaces that these fluctuations explore likely contain active conformations that are critical for their function. More interestingly, these fluctuations can respond actively to external cues, which introduces layers of tight regulation on the biological processes that they dictate. A growing number of studies have suggested that conformational dynamics of proteins govern their role in regulating biological functions, examples of this regulation can be found in signal transduction, molecular recognition, apoptosis, protein / ion / other molecules translocation and gene expression. On the experimental side, the technical advances have offered deep insights into the conformational motions of a number of proteins. These studies greatly enrich our knowledge of the interplay between structure and function. On the theoretical side, novel approaches and detailed computational simulations have provided powerful tools in the study of enzyme catalysis, protein / drug design, protein / ion / other molecule translocation and protein folding/aggregation, to name but a few. This work contains detailed information, not only on the conformational motions of biological systems, but also on the potential governing forces of conformational dynamics (transient interactions, chemical and physical origins, thermodynamic properties). New developments in computational simulations will greatly enhance our understanding of how these molecules function in various biological events.},

The backbone flexibility was described in terms of order parameters and correlation times, commonly used in the NMR relaxation analysis. Special attention was paid to the effect of conformational changes on the nanosecond time scale. Time-dependent order parameters were determined in order to separate motions occurring on different time scales. As an alternative approach, slow conformational changes were identified from the backbone torsion angle variances, and “conformationally filtered” order parameters were calculated for well-defined conformation states. A comparison of the data obtained for the free and pheromone-bound protein showed that some residues are more rigid in the bound form, but a larger portion of the protein becomes more flexible upon the pheromone binding. This finding is in general agreement with the NMR results. The higher flexibility observed on the fast (fs−ps) time scale was typically observed for the residues exhibiting higher conformational freedom on the ns time scale. An inspection of the hydrogen bond network provided a structural explanation for the flexibility differences between the free and pheromone-bound proteins in the simulations.},

	abstract = {Innovative algorithms have been developed during the past decade for simulating Newtonian physics for macromolecules. A major goal is alleviation of the severe requirement that the integration timestep be small enough to resolve the fastest components of the motion and thus guarantee numerical stability. This timestep problem is challenging if strictly faster methods with the same all-atom resolution at small timesteps are sought. Mathematical techniques that have worked well in other multiple-timescale contexts—where the fast motions are rapidly decaying or largely decoupled from others—have not been as successful for biomolecules, where vibrational coupling is strong. This review examines general issues that limit the timestep and describes available methods (constrained, reduced-variable, implicit, symplecttic, multiple-timestep, and normal-mode-based schemes). A section compares results of selected integrators for a model dipeptide, assessing physical and numerical performance. Included is our dual timestep method LN, which relies on an approximate linearization of the equations of motion every Δt interval (5 fs or less), the solution of which is obtained by explicit integration at the inner timestep Δτ (e.g., 0.5 fs). LN is computationally competitive, providing 4–5 speedup factors, and results are in good agreement, in comparison to 0.5 fs trajectories. These collective algorithmic efforts help fill the gap between the time range that can be simulated and the timespans of major biological interest (milliseconds and longer). Still, only a hierarchy of models and methods, along with experimentational improvements, will ultimately give theoretical modeling the status of partner with experiment.},

	abstract = {To meet the challenge of modeling the conformational dynamics of biological macromolecules over long time scales, much recent effort has been devoted to constructing stochastic kinetic models, often in the form of discrete-state Markov models, from short molecular dynamics simulations. To construct useful models that faithfully represent dynamics at the time scales of interest, it is necessary to decompose configuration space into a set of kinetically metastable states. Previous attempts to define these states have relied upon either prior knowledge of the slow degrees of freedom or on the application of conformational clustering techniques which assume that conformationally distinct clusters are also kinetically distinct. Here, we present a first version of an automatic algorithm for the discovery of kinetically metastable states that is generally applicable to solvated macromolecules. Given molecular dynamics trajectories initiated from a well-defined starting distribution, the algorithm discovers long lived, kinetically metastable states through successive iterations of partitioning and aggregating conformation space into kinetically related regions.

	abstract = {A molecular-level understanding of the function of a protein requires knowledge of both its structural and dynamic properties. NMR spectroscopy allows the measurement of generalized order parameters that provide an atomistic description of picosecond and nanosecond fluctuations in protein structure. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation provides a complementary approach to the study of protein dynamics on similar time scales. Comparisons between NMR spectroscopy and MD simulations can be used to interpret experimental results and to improve the quality of simulation-related force fields and integration methods. However, apparent systematic discrepancies between order parameters extracted from simulations and experiments are common, particularly for elements of noncanonical secondary structure. In this paper, results from a 1.2 μs explicit solvent MD simulation of the protein ubiquitin are compared with previously determined backbone order parameters derived from NMR relaxation experiments [Tjandra, N.; Feller, S. E.; Pastor, R. W.; Bax, A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 12562−12566]. The simulation reveals fluctuations in three loop regions that occur on time scales comparable to or longer than that of the overall rotational diffusion of ubiquitin and whose effects would not be apparent in experimentally derived order parameters. A coupled analysis of internal and overall motion yields simulated order parameters substantially closer to the experimentally determined values than is the case for a conventional analysis of internal motion alone. Improved agreement between simulation and experiment also is encouraging from the viewpoint of assessing the accuracy of long MD simulations.},

	abstract = {A goal in the kinetic characterization of a macromolecular system is the description of its slow relaxation processes via (i) identification of the structural changes involved in these processes and (ii) estimation of the rates or timescales at which these slow processes occur. Most of the approaches to this task, including Markov models, master-equation models, and kinetic network models, start by discretizing the high-dimensional state space and then characterize relaxation processes in terms of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a discrete transition matrix. The practical success of such an approach depends very much on the ability to finely discretize the slow order parameters. How can this task be achieved in a high-dimensional configuration space without relying on subjective guesses of the slow order parameters? In this paper, we use the variational principle of conformation dynamics to derive an optimal way of identifying the “slow subspace” of a large set of prior order parameters – either generic internal coordinates or a user-defined set of parameters. Using a variational formulation of conformational dynamics, it is shown that an existing method—the time-lagged independent component analysis—provides the optional solution to this problem. In addition, optimal indicators—order parameters indicating the progress of the slow transitions and thus may serve as reaction coordinates—are readily identified. We demonstrate that the slow subspace is well suited to construct accurate kinetic models of two sets of molecular dynamics simulations, the 6-residue fluorescent peptide MR121-GSGSW and the 30-residue intrinsically disordered peptide kinase inducible domain (KID). The identified optimal indicators reveal the structural changes associated with the slow processes of the molecular system under analysis.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of five water models, the TIP3P (original and modified), SPC (original and refined), and SPC/E (original), were performed using the CHARMM molecular mechanics program. All simulations were carried out in the microcanonical NVE ensemble, using 901 water molecules in a cubic simulation cell furnished with periodic boundary conditions at 298 K. The SHAKE algorithm was used to keep water molecules rigid. Nanosecond trajectories were calculated with all water models for high statistical accuracy. The characteristic self-diffusion coefficients D and radial distribution functions, gOO, gOH, and gHH for all five water models were determined and compared to experimental data. The effects of velocity rescaling on the self-diffusion coefficient D were examined. All these empirical water models used in this study are similar by having three interaction sites, but the small differences in their pair potentials composed of Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Coulombic terms give significant differences in the calculated self-diffusion coefficients, and in the height of the second peak of the radial distribution function gOO.},

	abstract = {CHARMM (Chemistry at HARvard Molecular Mechanics) is a highly versatile
                    and widely used molecular simulation program. It has been developed over the
                    last three decades with a primary focus on molecules of biological interest,
                    including proteins, peptides, lipids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and small
                    molecule ligands, as they occur in solution, crystals, and membrane
                    environments. For the study of such systems, the program provides a large suite
                    of computational tools that include numerous conformational and path sampling
                    methods, free energy estimators, molecular minimization, dynamics, and analysis
                    techniques, and model-building capabilities. In addition, the CHARMM program is
                    applicable to problems involving a much broader class of many-particle systems.
                    Calculations with CHARMM can be performed using a number of different energy
                    functions and models, from mixed quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical force
                    fields, to all-atom classical potential energy functions with explicit solvent
                    and various boundary conditions, to implicit solvent and membrane models. The
                    program has been ported to numerous platforms in both serial and parallel
                    architectures. This paper provides an overview of the program as it exists today

Recent modifications to the Amber and CHARMM protein force fields, for example, have improved the backbone torsion potentials, remedying deficiencies in earlier versions. Here, we further advance simulation accuracy by improving the amino acid side-chain torsion potentials of the Amber ff99SB force field. First, we used simulations of model alpha-helical systems to identify the four residue types whose rotamer distribution differed the most from expectations based on Protein Data Bank statistics. Second, we optimized the side-chain torsion potentials of these residues to match new, high-level quantum-mechanical calculations. Finally, we used microsecond-timescale MD simulations in explicit solvent to validate the resulting force field against a large set of experimental NMR measurements that directly probe side-chain conformations. The new force field, which we have termed Amber ff99SB-ILDN, exhibits considerably better agreement with the NMR data. Proteins 2010. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {We present the first global parameterization and validation of a novel charge model, called AM1-BCC, which quickly and efficiently generates high-quality atomic charges for computer simulations of organic molecules in polar media. The goal of the charge model is to produce atomic charges that emulate the HF/6-31G* electrostatic potential (ESP) of a molecule. Underlying electronic structure features, including formal charge and electron delocalization, are first captured by AM1 population charges; simple additive bond charge corrections (BCCs) are then applied to these AM1 atomic charges to produce the AM1-BCC charges. The parameterization of BCCs was carried out by fitting to the HF/6-31G* ESP of a training set of {\textgreater}2700 molecules. Most organic functional groups and their combinations were sampled, as well as an extensive variety of cyclic and fused bicyclic heteroaryl systems. The resulting BCC parameters allow the AM1-BCC charging scheme to handle virtually all types of organic compounds listed in The Merck Index and the NCI Database. Validation of the model was done through comparisons of hydrogen-bonded dimer energies and relative free energies of solvation using AM1-BCC charges in conjunction with the 1994 Cornell et al. forcefield for AMBER.13 Homo- and hetero-dimer hydrogen-bond energies of a diverse set of organic molecules were reproduced to within 0.95 kcal/mol RMS deviation from the ab initio values, and for DNA dimers the energies were within 0.9 kcal/mol RMS deviation from ab initio values. The calculated relative free energies of solvation for a diverse set of monofunctional isosteres were reproduced to within 0.69 kcal/mol of experiment. In all these validation tests, AMBER with the AM1-BCC charge model maintained a correlation coefficient above 0.96. Thus, the parameters presented here for use with the AM1-BCC method present a fast, accurate, and robust alternative to HF/6-31G* ESP-fit charges for general use with the AMBER force field in computer simulations involving organic small molecules. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Theory Comput.2010, 7, 525–537) have been extended to the prediction of pKa shifts of active site residues and ionizable ligand groups in protein–ligand complexes. We present new algorithms that allow pKa shifts due to inductive (i.e., covalently coupled) intraligand interactions, as well as noncovalently coupled interligand interactions in multiligand complexes, to be included in the prediction. The number of different ligand chemical groups that are automatically recognized has been increased to 18, and the general implementation has been changed so that new functional groups can be added easily by the user, aided by a new and more general protonation scheme. Except for a few cases, the new algorithms in PROPKA3.1 are found to yield results similar to or better than those obtained with PROPKA2.0 (Bas et al. Proteins: Struct., Funct., Bioinf.2008, 73, 765–783). Finally, we present a novel algorithm that identifies noncovalently coupled ionizable groups, where pKa prediction may be especially difficult. This is a general improvement to PROPKA and is applied to proteins with and without ligands.},

The algorithm consists of three phases: assembly of an initial 3D structure from a library of fragments; exhaustive enumeration of all rotatable torsions using values drawn from a knowledge-based list of angles, thereby generating a large set of conformations; and sampling of this set by geometric and energy criteria. Validation of conformer generators like OMEGA has often been undertaken by comparing computed conformer sets to experimental molecular conformations from crystallography, usually from the Protein Databank (PDB). Such an approach is fraught with difficulty due to the systematic problems with small molecule structures in the PDB. Methods are presented to identify a diverse set of small molecule structures from cocomplexes in the PDB that has maximal reliability. A challenging set of 197 high quality, carefully selected ligand structures from well-solved models was obtained using these methods. This set will provide a sound basis for comparison and validation of conformer generators in the future. Validation results from this set are compared to the results using structures of a set of druglike molecules extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). OMEGA is found to perform very well in reproducing the crystallographic conformations from both these data sets using two complementary metrics of success.},

However, the estimation, validation, and analysis of such models is far from trivial and involves sophisticated and often numerically sensitive methods. In this work we present the open-source Python package PyEMMA (http://pyemma.org) that provides accurate and efficient algorithms for kinetic model construction. PyEMMA can read all common molecular dynamics data formats, helps in the selection of input features, provides easy access to dimension reduction algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA) and time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA) and clustering algorithms such as k-means, and contains estimators for MSMs, hidden Markov models, and several other models. Systematic model validation and error calculation methods are provided. PyEMMA offers a wealth of analysis functions such that the user can conveniently compute molecular observables of interest. We have derived a systematic and accurate way to coarse-grain MSMs to few states and to illustrate the structures of the metastable states of the system. Plotting functions to produce a manuscript-ready presentation of the results are available. In this work, we demonstrate the features of the software and show new methodological concepts and results produced by PyEMMA.},

Followed by a joint dose–response analysis to confirm the hits, the identified actives were then effectively triaged by a structure-based hit-classification approach to three prioritized series. Two distinct scaffolds were identified as tractable starting points for potential lead chemistry work. The oxoindoline series bind at the right-hand side of the active-site pocket with hydrogen bonds to the protein. The 2-phenylbenzimidazole-4-sulfonamide series bind at the central channel with significant induced fit, which has not been previously reported. On the basis of the encouraging initial results, we envision that a new lead series with improved properties could be generated if a vector is found that could merge the cyclohexyl functionality of the oxoindoline series with the trifluoromethyl moiety of the 2-phenylbenzimidazole-4-sulfonamide series.},

We recently examined the stability of self-docking poses under molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and showed that equilibrium MD simulations have some capability to discriminate between correct and decoy poses. Here, we have extended our previous work to cross-docking studies for practical applications. Three target proteins (thrombin, heat shock protein 90-alpha, and cyclin-dependent kinase 2) of pharmaceutical interest were selected. Three comparable poses (one correct pose and two decoys) for each ligand were then selected from the docking poses. To obtain the docking poses for the three target proteins, we used three different protocols, namely: normal docking, induced fit docking (IFD), and IFD against the homology model. Finally, five parallel MD equilibrium runs were performed on each pose for the statistical analysis. The results showed that the correct poses were generally more stable than the decoy poses under MD. The discrimination capability of MD depends on the strategy. The safest way was to judge a pose as being stable if any one run among five parallel runs was stable under MD. In this case, 95\% of the correct poses were retained under MD, and about 25–44\% of the decoys could be excluded by the simulations for all cases. On the other hand, if we judge a pose as being stable when any two or three runs were stable, with the risk of incorrectly excluding some correct poses, approximately 31–53\% or 39–56\% of the two decoys could be excluded by MD, respectively. Our results suggest that simple equilibrium simulations can serve as an effective filter to exclude decoy poses that cannot be distinguished by docking scores from the computationally expensive free-energy calculations.},

In general, docking and scoring functions perform unsatisfactorily in this application. Docking calculations, followed by molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations can be applied to improve the predictions. However, for targets with large, flexible binding sites, with no experimentally determined binding modes for a set of ligands, insufficient sampling can decrease the accuracy of the free energy calculations. Cytochrome P450s, a protein family of major importance for drug metabolism, is an example of a challenging target for binding affinity predictions. As a result, the choice of starting structure from the docking solutions becomes crucial. In this study, an iterative scheme is introduced that includes multiple independent molecular dynamics simulations to obtain weighted ensemble averages to be used in the linear interaction energy method. The proposed scheme makes the initial pose selection less crucial for further simulation, as it automatically calculates the relative weights of the various poses. It also properly takes into account the possibility that multiple binding modes contribute similarly to the overall affinity, or of similar compounds occupying very different poses. The method was applied to a set of 12 compounds binding to cytochrome P450 2C9 and it displayed a root mean-square error of 2.9 kJ/mol.},

In the current paper, we propose a computational modeling workflow using the combination of docking, classical molecular dynamics (cMD), accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) and free-energy perturbation (FEP+ protocol) for identification of possible ligand binding modes. It was applied for investigation of selected perfluorocarboxyl acids (PFCAs) in the PPARγ nuclear receptor. Although both regular and induced fit docking failed to reproduce the experimentally determined binding mode of the ligands when docked into a non-native X-ray structure, cMD and aMD simulations successfully identified the most probable binding conformations. Moreover, multiple binding modes were identified for all of these compounds and the shorter-chain PFCAs continuously moved between a few energetically favorable binding conformations. On the basis of MD predictions of binding conformations, we applied the default and also redesigned FEP+ sampling protocols, which accurately reproduced experimental differences in the binding energies. Thus, the preliminary MD simulations can also provide helpful information about correct setup of the FEP+ calculations. These results show that the PFCA binding modes were accurately predicted and that the FEP+ protocol can be used to estimate free energies of binding of flexible ligands that are not typical druglike compounds. Our in silico workflow revealed the specific ligand–residue interactions within the ligand binding domain and the main characteristics of the PFCAs, and it was concluded that these compounds are week PPARγ partial agonists. This work also suggests a common pipeline for identification of ligand binding modes, ligand–protein dynamics description, and relative free-energy calculations.},

Recent improvements in the intensities of laboratory X-ray sources permits the collection of greater amounts of high-quality diffraction data and have been matched by developments in automation, crystallisation and data analysis. Developments in NMR screening, including the use of cryogenically cooled NMR probes and 19F-containing reporter molecules have expanded the scope of this technique, while increasing the availability of binding site and quantitative affinity data for the fragments. Application of these methods has led to a greater knowledge of the chemical variety, structural features and energetics of protein–fragment interactions. While fragment-based screening has already been shown to reduce the timescales of the drug discovery process, a more detailed characterisation of fragment screening hits can reveal unexpected similarities between fragment chemotypes and protein active sites leading to improved understanding of the pharmacophores and the re-use of this information against other protein targets.},

The approach first identifies starting points: very small molecules (fragments) that are about half the size of typical drugs. These fragments are then expanded or linked together to generate drug leads. Although the origins of the technique date back some 30 years, it was only in the mid-1990s that experimental techniques became sufficiently sensitive and rapid for the concept to be become practical. Since that time, the field has exploded: FBDD has played a role in discovery of at least 18 drugs that have entered the clinic, and practitioners of FBDD can be found throughout the world in both academia and industry. Literally dozens of reviews have been published on various aspects of FBDD or on the field as a whole, as have three books (Jahnke and Erlanson, Fragment-based approaches in drug discovery, 2006; Zartler and Shapiro, Fragment-based drug discovery: a practical approach, 2008; Kuo, Fragment based drug design: tools, practical approaches, and examples, 2011).

	abstract = {Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) represents a change in strategy from the screening of molecules with higher molecular weights and physical properties more akin to fully drug-like compounds, to the screening of smaller, less complex molecules. This is because it has been recognised that fragment hit molecules can be efficiently grown and optimised into leads, particularly after the binding mode to the target protein has been first determined by 3D structural elucidation, e.g. by NMR or X-ray crystallography. Several studies have shown that medicinal chemistry optimisation of an already drug-like hit or lead compound can result in a final compound with too high molecular weight and lipophilicity. The evolution of a lower molecular weight fragment hit therefore represents an attractive alternative approach to optimisation as it allows better control of compound properties. Computational chemistry can play an important role both prior to a fragment screen, in producing a target focussed fragment library, and post-screening in the evolution of a drug-like molecule from a fragment hit, both with and without the available fragment-target co-complex structure. We will review many of the current developments in the area and illustrate with some recent examples from successful FBDD discovery projects that we have conducted.},

	abstract = {Human serum albumin possesses multiple binding sites and transports a wide range of ligands that include the anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen. A complete map of the binding sites of ibuprofen in albumin is difficult to obtain in traditional experiments, because of the structural adaptability of this protein in accommodating small ligands. In this work, we provide a set of predictions covering the geometry, affinity of binding and protonation state for the pharmaceutically most active form (S– isomer) of ibuprofen to albumin, by using absolute binding free energy calculations in combination with classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and molecular docking. The most favorable binding modes correctly reproduce several experimentally identified binding locations, which include the two Sudlow's drug sites (DS2 and DS1) and the fatty acid binding sites 6 and 2 (FA6 and FA2). Previously unknown details of the binding conformations were revealed for some of them, and formerly undetected binding modes were found in other protein sites. The calculated binding affinities exhibit trends which seem to agree with the available experimental data, and drastically degrade when the ligand is modeled in a protonated (neutral) state, indicating that ibuprofen associates with albumin preferentially in its charged form. These findings provide a detailed description of the binding of ibuprofen, help to explain a wide range of results reported in the literature in the last decades, and demonstrate the possibility of using simulation methods to predict ligand binding to albumin., Alchemical free energy methods can identify favored binding modes of a ligand within a large protein with multiple binding sites,},

Alchemical free energy calculations seek to change that by providing rigorous binding free energies from molecular simulations. Given adequate sampling and an accurate enough force field, these techniques yield accurate free energy estimates. Recent innovations in alchemical techniques have sparked a resurgence of interest in these calculations. Still, many obstacles stand in the way of their routine application in a drug discovery context, including the one we focus on here, sampling. Sampling of binding modes poses a particular challenge as binding modes are often separated by large energy barriers, leading to slow transitions. Binding modes are difficult to predict, and in some cases multiple binding modes may contribute to binding. In view of these hurdles, we present a framework for dealing carefully with uncertainty in binding mode or conformation in the context of free energy calculations.
